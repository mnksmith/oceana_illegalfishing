# Fighting Illegal Fishing: Global Fishing Watch and Oceana
## Background

We are facing an ocean health crisis.  Climate change, ocean acidification, pollution, and overfishing are stretching marine ecosystems to the breaking point, threatening their ability to sustainably provide food and livelihood to billions of people around the world.  Rampant overfishing has imperiled global commercial fish stock to the point that nearly 90% of the worldâ€™s fisheries are already fully exploited, over-exploited, or depleted to the point of collapse.  Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is a major contributor to this crisis, accounting for an estimated 20% of the total catch and costing tens of billions of dollars annually.  The perpetrators of IUU fishing ignore protected areas, use harmful and invasive fishing techniques, follow no standards of health and sanitation, and are often associated with other illegal activities such as forced labor and even human trafficking.

## Fighting IUU

By nature, combating IUU fishing is a formidable challenge.  It often takes place outside of governmental jurisdiction on the high seas or in the waters of developing countries that lack the resources to enforce the law.  Illegal fishing vessels change names, owners, and flags frequently, and will turn off or manipulate required tracking systems to obscure their locations.  The fish is transported by third-party reefer ships and brought to market hidden under a false species designation.  Licensing and other documentation is forged and money earned disappears behind the borders of haven countries.  Even efforts to define the scope of the problem have been confounded by this complex tangle of issues and its globalized nature.
